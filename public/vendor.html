                You may be familiar with the benefits of CLM, but not all solutions are made equal. It’s important to find one that will meet your needs now—and in the future. The checklist below details some of the most important capabilities to consider as you evaluate CLM solutions.

Configurable workflows: This is at the core of the automation CLM offers, so be sure to dig deep here. Look for a solution that lets you build custom workflows, with enough flexibility to meet your specific needs.

Document generation capabilities: Find a solution that lets you create preconfigured templates, which automatically pull data and pre-approved language into contracts.

Integrations: Your organization is more likely to use CLM when it works with systems you already use. Seek out a solution that can integrate with your key systems of record like Salesforce, NetSuite or SAP Ariba.

Security: Ideally, the solution is certified in leading regulatory and industry standards like ISO 27001:2013, SOC 2, and FedRAMP.  

Centralized repository: Find a solution that stores contracts in a permission-controlled repository, leading to better organization, search and access. 

Ease of implementation: Select a solution that meets your budget and timeline. The more customization you need, the more you should expect to invest.

Support and services: Support and services are critical to getting things done right and should be heavily scrutinized to ensure success.
