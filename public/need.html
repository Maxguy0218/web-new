            <p>A strong indication your organization could benefit from CLM is if there are frequently bottlenecks in your contract process. Do you find that your team’s contracts are often stalled at the generation, approval or signing stages, creating a slow process and poor experience? Here’s what several Docusign customers found that led them to consider CLM.
                “Our business had been using Salesforce for about 5 years and they decided that they likely weren’t utilizing the system to its capabilities and that they needed to bring on a Salesforce admin, so they hired me. It only took me about a month or two to realize that people were using the system in largely time-consuming, manual processes to generate documents. This was a large stressor on time, and when we initially discovered eSignature with Docusign we thought, there has to be an easier way to pre-fill these documents with Salesforce, and it snowballed from there. We found CLM products through research.” - Kim Wargo, FineMark Bank
                “Prior to the pandemic, we had discussions around some issues in contracting processes that we were having. Specifically, a lot of manual processes, and we started to think about some technology solutions that might be able to help us there. Of course the pandemic exacerbated our situation and set a lot of pieces in motion. We were forced to move most of our workforce remotely and were very dependent on paper processes and wet ink signatures. We decided to move to Docusign eSignature, and then realized the issues we were having with email managed agreements.” - Mick Mitchell, Oregon Health Authority.</p>
