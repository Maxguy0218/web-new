                Contract lifecycle management solutions automate and standardize the contract process. With major bottlenecks eliminated, the contract process speeds up so deals close sooner, expediting the time to revenue. Common benefits include:

Increased efficiency 

Reduced risk

Reduced error rates

Increased productivity

Greater visibility

Better experience

Here are some of the benefits we’ve heard from our customers about the ROI they have experienced after implementing Docusign CLM:

“Throughput times in the paper contracting process ranged from 60 to greater than 100 days to completing a contract request. We now target 60 days or less for new contracts, 30 days or less for contract amendments. We’ve slashed the amount of time that we spend managing our contracts in general with the automation that Docusign CLM provides.” - Mick Mitchell, Oregon Health Authority

“We took a process that used to take hours of onboarding down to the click of a button, the ROI with Docusign CLM was immediate and saved time and money from the beginning.” - Kim Wargo, FineMark Bank

“Docusign CLM has enabled me to be extremely service-oriented with my team—at a low cost. I’m working faster and more collaboratively, this is due to streamlining our agreement lifecycle by transforming outdated, analog processes—such as lease tracking—into a digital automated workflow that saves employees time and reduces dependency on the legal team” - Drybar
