            <p>One thing that is unique about the contract process is that it involves multiple departments across the organization. However, the systems each of those departments uses aren’t often connected to one another. For example, an HR offer letter initiates in HR (HCM), and before it can be sent, finance might have to approve it (ERP). And once signed, IT must provision the new employee (ServiceNow). If these different systems are not connected, it can result in a lot of duplicate work (and potential for error) as information from contracts is re-entered into each system.

                Here are the integrations that Docusign customers prioritized as part of their CLM consideration process:
                
                “Docusign offers a Salesforce integration which was incredibly important for us, we’re looking to upgrade to the newest version of CLM and at that point getting Apps Launcher which will be important for us to build customization and document flow.” - Kim Wargo, FineMark Bank
                
                Due to the seamless integration between Salesforce and Docusign CLM, Wargo was able to build 100 document templates in just three weeks, a process that would have taken 3+ months with her previous system. Now, trust packets, which can consist of up to 45 documents, require only 30 minutes to create, rather than the 4 to 5 hours it took previously.
                
                FineMark also leverages an API integration with nCino, so that loan negotiation and contract completion all happen in one system.</p>
